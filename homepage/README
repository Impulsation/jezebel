A couple things to note:

Both the "cache" folder and the "scratchpad" filed must be given
CHMOD 777 permissions, so they can be written to properly.

This is an unfinished project, particularly the PHP portions as
I know they could be drastically cleaned up and made more efficient
and flexible. If you like what you see, check back for updates.

The LastRSS plugin definitely has some limitations in its current
release, that make reading values from more complex tags not
possible. I've worked around this as best as I can even if in
sloppy ways. I'm considering modifying the plugin myself, so
that my parsing and formatting routines aren't such a mess. If I
do so, I will definitely fork my work.
