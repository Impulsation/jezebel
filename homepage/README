A COUPLE THINGS TO NOTE:

Both the "cache" folder and the "scratchpad" file must be given
CHMOD 777 permissions, so they can be written to properly.

My source uses curl and json routines, so make sure you have the
according php5 packages installed

There are configuration variables that need to be set within
the ./index.php source. They are at the very top, and are commented
for your understanding and convenience.

All the interesting stuff you may want to modify and tweak
will probably be in ./plugins/functions.php and also have
been detailedly commented.

I have slightly modified the LastRSS plugin, and all
modifications are noted at the top of the plugin file
source itself.

This homepage was designed for use with Firefox/Iceweasel. I
have done my best to bug test with Chromium, and added a few
hacks so that it works (and looks) as fluidly as possible.

Other webkit-based browsers seem to be hit or miss; for instance,
dwb displays flawlessly, while surf still wants to cut off some of
the scrollbar in our scratchpad when it overflows. Most issues you
may encounter can probably be remedied by minor margin/padding
tweaks in ./css/style.css.

As always, this will continue to be a WIP and I will most likely
push more update commits in future.
